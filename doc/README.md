# Motivation

In software architecture is important to design a flexible system that will allow future changes without much resistance.
This flexibility becomes even more important in systems that are data intensive. In such system, it is common to relly
in a wide variety of storage solution to maximize their performance for a given task - reporting, real-time analytics, etc.
